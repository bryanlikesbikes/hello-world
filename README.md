# hello-world

Hi.
I'm Bryan.

I'm currently working as a chef, but after 15 years of not having weekends, holidays, evenings, birthdays, anniversaries, or anything else off, I've become sick of it. Compound that with the fact that I make less after 15 years of qork than an entry level coder does, and I'm ready for a change.

So, I've decided to learn how to do front end development. 

We will see if it works.
